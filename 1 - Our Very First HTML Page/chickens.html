          The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
          species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the
          Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia.
          Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male
          may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon.
          An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is
          called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
          food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally
          they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some
          places. The chicken domesticated for its meat are Broilers and for its
          eggs are Layers.

          Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
          with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more
          than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any
          other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens â€“ in
          myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.
